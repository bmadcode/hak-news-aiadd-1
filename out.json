Swift Build, already used by Xcode to support millions of apps and Appleâ€™s internal build processes, now extends its capabilities to Linux and Windows. The build system transforms user inputs like source code into output artifacts such as libraries, command-line tools, and applications, playing a critical role in developer productivity and project architecture. Built on the **llbuild** project, Swift Build integrates robustly with the Swift compiler, supports diverse product types, and optimizes build graphs for parallelism.\n\nThis release aims to unify the build experience across platforms by integrating Swift Build into **Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM)**, addressing inconsistencies between Xcode and SwiftPM. The move will provide a consistent, cross-platform build engine, enabling future performance optimizations and developer-facing features. Apple invites the community to contribute via GitHub and share feedback on the Swift forums, marking a significant step toward a unified and polished development experience for Swift developers worldwide.","summaryGeneratedAt":"2025-02-01T21:17:15.215Z","tokenCount":1000},"commentsSummary":{"summary":"The comments discuss concerns about Swift's strong ties to Apple and its potential impact on the language's broader adoption and appeal. **Uhura** argues that Swift's positioning as \"good for everything but better for Apple platforms\" may harm its growth, suggesting that competitors benefit from being more open-source, having more contributors, and maintaining a narrower focus. They propose open-sourcing all tooling, like Xcode, to bridge the gap with other languages. **Kelnos** draws parallels between Swift and Microsoft's C#/.NET, noting Swift's even tighter integration with Apple, which deters non-Apple users like themselves. **Codr7** acknowledges Swift's innovative core but expresses skepticism about Apple's long-term commitment. **JTyQZSnP3cQGa8B** questions the practicality of investing time in Swift when alternatives like Python, Kotlin, and Rust offer broader support, momentum, and platform independence. They criticize Apple's attempt to balance being the \"best\" computing platform while appealing to a wider audience, suggesting it creates a dilemma. **Kelnos** adds that macOS, despite its premium status, has never dominated market share and has become less user-friendly over time, further undermining Apple's claim to being the \"best.\" Overall, the comments highlight concerns about Swift's ecosystem limitations, Apple's restrictive approach, and the growing appeal of more open and versatile programming languages.","summaryGeneratedAt":"2025-02-01T21:17:06.998Z","tokenCount":905}}],"meta":{"fetchedAt":"2025-02-01T21:18:09.304Z","processingTimeMs":111,"storiesRetrieved":1,"totalCommentsRetrieved":1,"totalTokensUsed":1905}}
