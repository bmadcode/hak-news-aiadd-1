## Project Overview

HakNews is an intelligent news digest service that delivers curated summaries of top Hacker News stories and discussions directly to your inbox. The service leverages AI to provide concise, meaningful summaries of both articles and community discussions, helping tech professionals stay informed without information overload.

## Features

- Fetch top stories from Hacker News with comments
- AI-powered summarization of articles and comments
- Configurable number of stories and comments
- Rate limiting and caching for optimal performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type-safe API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## HAKATA - HackerNews AI Agent KATA

This repository serves as an exercise in the Agentic AI IDE Workflow Kata (HAKATA).

### What is a Kata?

The term "kata" (åž‹ or å½¢) originates from Japanese martial arts, referring to detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. In software development, a kata is a coding exercise that developers practice repeatedly to hone their skills, improve muscle memory, and master specific techniques or patterns.

### The AI Agentic PRD Story Workflow

This project implements the AIA gentic PRD Story Workflow - a systematic approach to software development using AI agents:

1. **Detailed PRD Creation**: Comprehensive documentation of requirements, architecture, and technical decisions, AC, and tasks
2. **Story-Based Development**: Breaking down the project into manageable stories
3. **AI-Driven Implementation**: Step-by-step development with AI assistance
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Driver (human) approval and guidance throughout the process

#### Key Components:

- `.ai/` folder: Maintains story history and memory across chat sessions
- `.cursorrules`: Defines collaboration protocols between human and AI
- `.cursor/rules/story-template.mdc`: Standardized format for task breakdown and tracking
- `.cursor/rules/`: rules for the AI agent in multiple small files targeting file glob patterns

### Best Practices

- Work in small, granular tasks
- Ensure detailed task specifications to reduce ambiguity
- Follow TDD principles
- Document changes in story files
