# Story 5: Create POST API Route for Summarized Content from Hacker News API

## Story

**As a** user of the Hacker News API service\
**I want** to get summarized versions of top posts, their articles, and comments\
**so that** I can quickly understand the key points without reading everything in detail.

## Status: Completed

Efficiency Rating: 100%

## Context

Users need a convenient way to get summarized versions of top posts, articles, and comments from Hacker News to save time while staying informed.

## Estimation

5 story points

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create new POST endpoint `/api/v1/hacker-news/summarized-stories`
- [x] Handle parameters for number of stories, comments per story, and max summary length
- [x] Integrate with LLM service for generating concise summaries
- [x] Implement proper error handling for LLM API failures
- [x] Add rate limiting for the API endpoint
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- [x] Add end-to-end integration tests
- [x] Update API documentation with new endpoint details
- [x] Add CLI command for testing the summarization feature
- [x] Create usage examples in README
- [x] Handle LLM thinking tags properly
- [x] Adjust timeouts for better reliability

## Subtasks

1. [x] API Endpoint Implementation

   - [x] Create DTO for request/response
   - [x] Add input validation
   - [x] Implement controller endpoint
   - [x] Add rate limiting

2. [x] LLM Service Integration

   - [x] Implement content summarization
   - [x] Add caching layer
   - [x] Handle API failures gracefully
   - [x] Add retry mechanism
   - [x] Add thinking tag filtering
   - [x] Increase timeout for local LLM

3. [x] Service Integration

   - [x] Integrate with existing HN service
   - [x] Add content fetching logic
   - [x] Implement comment retrieval
   - [x] Add error handling

4. [x] Testing & Documentation
   - [x] Write unit tests for new components
   - [x] Add integration tests
   - [x] Update API documentation
   - [x] Add usage examples
   - [x] Create CLI testing command

## Constraints

- [x] Must handle LLM API failures gracefully
- [x] Must validate all input parameters
- [x] Must maintain type safety throughout
- [x] Must include proper rate limiting
- [x] Must have comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Must properly handle LLM thinking tags
- [x] Must handle timeouts appropriately

## Development Notes

- Using dependency injection for better testability
- Implementing circuit breaker for LLM service
- Added proper type safety in all components
- E2E tests verify all major functionality
- Added thinking tag filtering for cleaner summaries
- Increased local LLM timeout to 120 seconds
