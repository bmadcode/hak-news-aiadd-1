# Story 9: Email Subscription Management with DynamoDB

## Story

**As a** system administrator\
**I want** to manage email subscriptions in DynamoDB\
**so that** we can maintain a reliable list of subscribers for the Hacker News summary service.

## Status: Complete âœ…

## Context

Currently, our system can send emails to addresses provided in the POST request. However, we need a persistent storage solution to maintain a list of subscribers. This story implements DynamoDB tables and Lambda functions to manage email subscriptions, allowing users to subscribe and unsubscribe from the service.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

- [x] Set up environment configuration
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Verify infrastructure setup

   2. - [ ] Update email template with dynamic unsubscribe link
   3. - [x] Integrate with existing email service
5. - [ ] Testing
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for subscription service
   2. - [ ] Write E2E tests for subscription flow
   3. - [ ] Update existing email service tests
6. - [x] Subscriber Email Integration
   1. - [x] Make emails parameter optional in summarize API
   2. - [x] Fetch subscribers from DynamoDB when summarize API is called
   3. - [x] Merge provided emails with subscriber list
   4. - [x] Update email service to handle larger recipient lists
   5. - [x] Add error handling for email delivery failures

## Constraints

- Must use AWS SDK V3
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing email service
- Must handle duplicate subscriptions gracefully
- Must validate email addresses

## Dev Notes

### DynamoDB Table Design

**Table Name:** `hak-news-subscriptions`

#### Primary Key Structure

- Partition Key (pk): `STRING`
  - Format: `sub:{subscription-type}`
  - Example: `sub:hakdaily`, `sub:hakweekly`, `sub:ai:daily`
  - Used to group all emails for a specific subscription type
- Sort Key (sk): `STRING`
  - Contains the subscriber's email address
  - Enables efficient retrieval of all subscribers for a subscription type

#### Attributes

- `pk` (STRING) - Partition key, identifies subscription type
- `sk` (STRING) - Sort key, subscriber's email address
- `createdAt` (NUMBER) - Unix timestamp of subscription creation
- `updatedAt` (NUMBER) - Unix timestamp of last update

#### Access Patterns

1. Get all subscribers for a subscription type:
   - Query where pk = 'sub:hakdaily'
   - Returns all email addresses for daily newsletter
2. Check if email is subscribed to a specific type:
   - GetItem with pk = 'sub:hakdaily' and sk = 'email@example.com'
3. Remove subscription:
   - DeleteItem with pk and sk
4. Add subscription:
   - PutItem with pk and sk

#### Table Configuration

- Billing Mode: PAY_PER_REQUEST (On-demand)
- Point-in-Time Recovery: Enabled
- Removal Policy: RETAIN (Prevents accidental deletion)

### Lambda IAM Role Requirements

The Lambda function has been granted the following DynamoDB permissions:

- `dynamodb:GetItem` - Check subscription status
- `dynamodb:PutItem` - Create new subscriptions
- `dynamodb:DeleteItem` - Remove subscriptions
- `dynamodb:Query` - Get all subscribers for a subscription type

These permissions are granted via the `grantReadWriteData()` method in the CDK stack.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are set in the Lambda function:

- `SUBSCRIPTIONS_TABLE_NAME`: Name of the DynamoDB table

### Additional Notes

- Simple, efficient design that supports multiple subscription types
- No need for status tracking - removal of record indicates unsubscription
- Scalable to support future subscription types (weekly, monthly, AI-specific, etc.)
- Efficient querying by subscription type

## Progress Notes As Needed
