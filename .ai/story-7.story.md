# Story 7: Consolidate to Single Summarization Route

## Story

**As a** developer\
**I want** to consolidate our API routes to a single summarization endpoint\
**so that** we have a cleaner, more focused API that only provides summarized content.

## Status: Complete ✅

## Context

Currently, we have two API routes: one for raw Hacker News data and another for summarized content. Since our service's primary purpose is to provide summarized content, we should remove the raw data endpoint and focus solely on the summarization functionality. This will simplify our API surface and reduce maintenance overhead.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove the `/api/v1/hacker-news/top-stories` endpoint
- [x] Remove associated top stories e2e tests
- [x] Remove the top stories command from package.json
- [x] Update API documentation to reflect the single endpoint
- [x] Ensure all existing summarization functionality remains intact
- [x] Verify no breaking changes to the summarization endpoint
- [x] Update README to reflect the simplified API structure

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Code Cleanup
   - [x] Remove top stories controller endpoint
   - [x] Remove top stories DTOs
   - [x] Clean up any unused imports
   - [x] Remove top stories command from package.json

2. - [x] Test Suite Updates
   - [x] Remove top-stories.e2e.ts
   - [x] Update any remaining tests that might reference removed functionality
   - [x] Verify all remaining tests pass
   - [x] Ensure test coverage remains above 80%

3. - [x] Documentation Updates
   - [x] Update API documentation
   - [x] Update README.md
   - [x] Update any relevant examples
   - [x] Review and update error messages if needed

## Constraints

- Must not introduce any breaking changes to the summarization endpoint
- Must maintain existing test coverage levels
- Must update all relevant documentation

## Development Notes

This is primarily a cleanup story to simplify our API surface. The focus is on removing unused functionality while ensuring we don't introduce any regressions in our core summarization feature.

## Progress Notes
