# Story 1: NestJS Configuration

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up a new NestJS project with proper configuration  
**so that** we have a solid foundation for building our Hacker News summarization service.

## Status

Complete

## Context

NestJS provides a robust framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. This story establishes the foundational project structure using NestJS CLI, ensuring we have the correct TypeScript configuration, project structure, and development environment setup. This is a crucial first step as all subsequent stories will build upon this foundation.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0.1 (approximately 10 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] NestJS CLI is globally installed and available
2. - [x] New NestJS project is created with TypeScript configuration
3. - [x] Project successfully builds with no errors
4. - [x] Development server can be started locally
5. - [x] Basic project structure follows NestJS best practices
6. - [x] Required dependencies for the project are properly configured in package.json
7. - [x] TypeScript configuration is optimized for our use case
8. - [x] Git repository is properly initialized with appropriate .gitignore

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Environment Setup
   1. - [x] Install Node.js 22 if not present
   2. - [x] Install NestJS CLI globally using npm
   3. - [x] Verify NestJS CLI installation
2. - [x] Project Creation
   1. - [x] Generate new NestJS project using CLI
   2. - [x] Configure TypeScript settings
   3. - [x] Add required dependencies to package.json
3. - [x] Project Configuration
   1. - [x] Set up development environment variables
   2. - [x] Configure basic project structure
   3. - [x] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
4. - [x] Verification
   1. - [x] Build project to verify configuration
   2. - [x] Start development server
   3. - [x] Run basic health check

## Constraints

- Must use Node.js 22
- Must use TypeScript
- Must follow NestJS best practices and architectural patterns
- Must ensure all configurations support future AWS deployment

## Dev Notes

- NestJS CLI command reference: `nest new project-name`
- Key dependencies to be added:
  - @nestjs/common
  - @nestjs/core
  - @nestjs/platform-express
  - TypeScript and related dev dependencies
- Will need to configure proper TypeScript settings for AWS Lambda compatibility

## Progress Notes As Needed

- Environment setup completed successfully:
  - Node.js v22.13.0 verified
  - NestJS CLI v11.0.2 installed and verified
- Project Creation completed:
  - Created new NestJS project with strict TypeScript configuration
  - TypeScript configuration verified with proper strict settings
  - Project builds successfully with no errors
  - Basic project structure created with NestJS best practices
- Project Configuration completed:
  - Fixed project directory structure to be at root level
  - Environment variables configured
  - Git repository properly initialized with comprehensive .gitignore
- Verification completed:
  - Project builds without errors
  - Development server starts successfully
  - Health check endpoint responds correctly
