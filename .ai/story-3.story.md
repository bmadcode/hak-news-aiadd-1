# Story 3: Configure and Deploy CDK Stack

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** to deploy our Hacker News API service to AWS using CDK  
**so that** we can securely serve our API endpoints in a production environment.

## Status

Completed

## Context

With our Hacker News API functionality implemented locally, we need to deploy it to AWS for production use. This involves setting up infrastructure as code using AWS CDK, configuring API Gateway with API key authentication, and ensuring our local development workflow seamlessly transitions to the production environment.

## Estimation

3. - [x] Create Lambda function to host NestJS application
4. - [x] Set up proper IAM roles and permissions
5. - [x] Configure environment variables for production
6. - [x] Deploy stack to AWS successfully
7. - [x] Verify API endpoints work in production
8. - [x] Update package.json commands to work with production environment
9. - [x] Document deployment process and configuration

   2. - [x] Configure API key authentication
   3. - [x] Set up proper CORS settings
3. - [x] Lambda Setup
   1. - [x] Create Lambda function construct
   2. - [x] Configure Node.js runtime
   3. - [x] Set up proper memory and timeout
4. - [x] Environment Configuration
   1. - [x] Set up environment variables
   2. - [x] Configure production settings
   3. - [x] Update local development workflow
5. - [x] Deployment & Testing
   1. - [x] Deploy stack to AWS
   2. - [x] Test endpoints with API key
   3. - [x] Verify environment configuration

## Constraints

- Must use AWS CDK v2
- Must implement proper security best practices
- Must use API key authentication for all routes
- Must maintain local development capability
- Must document all configuration and deployment steps

## Dev Notes

### Required AWS Resources

- API Gateway
- Lambda Function
- IAM Roles
- CloudWatch Logs

### CDK Configuration

```typescript
interface CdkStackProps extends cdk.StackProps {
  stage: 'dev' | 'prod';
  apiKeyName: string;
  // Add other configuration as needed
}
```

### Environment Variables

```typescript
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  NODE_ENV: string;
  API_KEY: string;
  RATE_LIMIT: number;
  // Add other environment variables as needed
}
```

## Progress Notes As Needed

### 2024-02-01 - CDK Project Initialization

- Completed initial CDK setup:
  - ✅ Installed AWS CDK CLI globally
  - ✅ Created infrastructure directory
  - ✅ Initialized CDK app with TypeScript template
  - ✅ Installed required AWS construct libraries

### 2024-02-01 - Basic Stack Implementation

- Created basic infrastructure stack with:
  - ✅ API Gateway configuration with stages
  - ✅ API Key authentication setup
  - ✅ Usage plan with rate limiting
  - ✅ Lambda execution role with proper permissions
  - ✅ CloudFormation outputs for important values

### 2024-02-01 - Lambda Configuration

- Implemented Lambda deployment setup:
  - ✅ Created build script for NestJS Lambda package
  - ✅ Configured Lambda function with Node.js 20.x runtime
  - ✅ Set up API Gateway integration with Lambda proxy
  - ✅ Added API key requirement to all routes
  - ✅ Configured proper timeout and memory settings

### 2024-02-01 - Environment Configuration

- Implemented environment configuration:
  - ✅ Created type-safe environment schema with Zod
  - ✅ Set up development and production configurations
  - ✅ Added all required environment variables for:
    - API Gateway settings
    - Lambda configuration
    - HN API integration
    - LLM service
    - Email service
  - ✅ Updated infrastructure stack to use configuration
  - ✅ Added proper validation and defaults

### 2024-02-01 - Deployment Configuration

- Created deployment infrastructure:
  - ✅ Created deployment script with environment support
  - ✅ Added deployment commands to package.json
  - ✅ Configured automatic API key retrieval
  - ✅ Added environment file generation
  - ✅ Implemented proper error handling

### 2024-02-01 - Successful Deployment and Testing

- Completed deployment and verification:
  - ✅ Successfully deployed CDK stack to AWS
  - ✅ Generated and stored API key in .env.production
  - ✅ API Gateway endpoint: https://p23e17axci.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
  - ✅ Tested API with successful response:
    - Top stories endpoint working with API key authentication
    - Response time ~312ms for story retrieval
    - Proper JSON formatting and data structure
    - All environment variables correctly configured
  - ✅ Production environment fully operational

### Next Steps:

1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Deploy to development environment
3. Verify deployment

## Deployment Instructions

1. Configure AWS credentials:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. Deploy to development:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:dev
   ```

3. Deploy to production:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

4. View changes before deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run diff:dev
   # or
   npm run diff:prod
   ```

The deployment script will:

1. Build the NestJS application
2. Package it for Lambda
3. Deploy the CDK stack
4. Retrieve and store the API key
5. Generate environment-specific configuration
